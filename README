	libGAL -- low-level GPU access library
******************************************************

libGAL (shortened as lGAL) is a FOS/libre library for using the GPU.

It is backed by OpenCL (for now) and written fully in C89 and has no other
dependencies, it is also extremely peformant and provides a good
balane between peformance user-friendliness.

       | ** IMPORTANT **
       |
       | This library is NOT meant for graphics, for that, use
       | something like SDL or OpenGL

quick set up
============

Download the lGAL library (static or dynamic) and add it to your compiler and
linker's path.

For example, a compile command on an UNIX system could look like:

    gcc file.c -llGAL -std=c99
